In the past, most of the IT services are based on central trust points and date stored in these systems are usually centralized. 
When the core trust points are hacked, it translates to losses for all nodes that rely on it. 
With the help of distributed ledger technology (DLT), data is shared, replicated, and synchronized among all the users in a decentralized network, thus no central points are involved.
